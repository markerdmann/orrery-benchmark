A key factor in his success is an uncanny ability to zero in on <em>high-leverage activities</em> – the tasks or decisions that yield outsized impact relative to effort. This report explores how Musk developed this skill, the early influences and formative experiences that shaped his thinking, and how he applies it across Tesla, SpaceX, Twitter (now X), and other ventures. We’ll draw on insights from biographers, employees, and industry experts to understand Musk’s approach to decision-making, including his now-famous 5-step “Algorithm.” Along the way, we’ll highlight practical takeaways and mental models you can use to cultivate a high-leverage mindset in your own endeavors.</p><h2>Early Influences and Formative Experiences</h2><p><strong>A Childhood “Raised by Books.”</strong> Musk’s ability to identify high-impact problems traces back to a youth steeped in reading and curiosity.

He moved to North America at 17, going on to study physics and economics at the University of Pennsylvania. Physics, with its rigorous reasoning from fundamental truths, became the bedrock of his thinking. <em>“Physics is a good framework for thinking… boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there,”</em> Musk says​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=First%20principles%20is%20kind%20of,then%20reason%20up%20from%20there" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>. This <em>first-principles thinking</em> would later become one of his signature decision-making tools.</p><p><strong>Big Questions and Bold Ambitions.</strong> As a college student, Musk consciously asked himself: <em>“What will most affect the future of humanity? What problems should I work on?”</em> He identified <strong>three areas</strong> – the internet, space exploration, and sustainable energy – as having the greatest potential impact​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.foundingfuel.com/article/ff-insights-645-elon-musk-and-the-art-of-asking-the-right-questions/#:~:text=part" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">foundingfuel.com</span></a></div></span></span>. That answer, shaped by his early influences, essentially laid out the roadmap for his career. By his mid-20s, he was acting on those high-leverage domains: diving into the internet boom with his first startup, Zip2; then online payments with X.com/PayPal; and eventually tackling space (SpaceX) and sustainable energy (Tesla and SolarCity). Biographer Ashlee Vance notes Musk <em>“set out to pursue three Moonshots”</em> after selling PayPal, channeling his newfound wealth into SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=conviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=After%20selling%20PayPal%2C%20with%20%24165M,companies%3A%20SolarCity%2C%20Tesla%20and%20SpaceX" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>.

He discovered he couldn’t manage people <em>“under the assumption that everyone operates the way he does,”</em> Vance writes​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-sets-nearly-impossible-goals-for-spacex-2015-5#:~:text=At%20his%20first%20company%2C%20the,Quest%20for%20a%20Fantastic%20Future" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">businessinsider.com</span></a></div></span></span>. This realization taught Musk the importance of clear purpose and exceptional hiring – you need a team who can keep up with ambitious goals. After Zip2 was sold, Musk co-founded X.com, which merged into PayPal. The PayPal experience reinforced his penchant for big-picture thinking: Musk’s grand vision was an online financial system (he even wanted to call it “X”), which was high-leverage in concept, though clashes over execution led to his ouster as CEO. Nonetheless, the sale of PayPal in 2002 gave Musk the <em>“ammo”</em> (around $165 million​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=conviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>) to fully pursue his high-impact passions in space and energy.</p><p><strong>Resilience and “No Limits” Mindset.</strong> Formative events in Musk’s life also contributed to his ability to pursue high-leverage goals.

Immigrating alone as a teenager taught him independence and risk-taking. Musk’s <strong>grandfather, Joshua Haldeman</strong>, was an adventurer who moved his family from Canada to South Africa and flew single-engine planes on record-breaking expeditions​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-world-according-to-elon-musks-grandfather#:~:text=The%20World%20According%20to%20Elon,impassioned%20defender%20of%20the" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">newyorker.com</span></a></div></span></span>. This family legacy of bold exploration likely influenced Musk’s tolerance for risk and audacious vision (one could say pursuing a Mars colony is the ultimate family road trip). All these early factors – intellectual curiosity, first-principles training, identifying big missions, hard lessons in startups, and personal resilience – combined to forge Musk’s skill in spotting what really matters. He learned to filter noise from signal and focus on opportunities that could “move the needle” most.</p><h2>First-Principles Thinking: A Foundation for High-Leverage Decisions</h2><p>One of Musk’s core techniques for identifying high-leverage activities is <strong>first-principles thinking</strong>.

By starting from scratch in this way, Musk often uncovers insights – and opportunities – that others miss.</p><p><strong>Rethinking Rockets from the Ground Up.</strong> A famous example is how Musk approached the high cost of rockets when starting SpaceX. Instead of accepting that “rockets are expensive” because that’s how it’s always been, he broke the problem into basics: <em>“What is a rocket made of?”</em> The answer: aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, titanium, copper, carbon fiber, etc. Next he asked, <em>“What is the value of those materials on the commodity market?”</em> It turned out the raw materials were only <strong>~2% of a rocket’s typical price</strong>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">achieve-personaltraining.com</span></a></div></span></span>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">achieve-personaltraining.com</span></a></div></span></span>. In other words, existing rocket manufacturers had an <em>“idiot index”</em> – Musk’s later term – of nearly 50x markup between material cost and sale price​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">achieve-personaltraining.com</span></a></div></span></span>. This first-principles analysis revealed a huge high-leverage opportunity: if SpaceX could design rockets using those same materials more efficiently, it could cut launch costs dramatically. Indeed, Musk concluded <em>“you can have batteries (or rockets) that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes”</em> by innovating in how materials are combined​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=With%20first%20principles%2C%20you%20say%2C,value%20of%20the%20material%20constituents%3F%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>. This insight led SpaceX to build Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 from scratch in-house, rather than buying costly rockets or parts. The result: SpaceX built launch vehicles for a fraction of the cost of competitors, enabling cheaper missions and ultimately the breakthrough of <em>reusable</em> rockets – a game-changing lever for the space industry.</p><p><strong>Reinventing Batteries and EVs.</strong> Musk applied the same first-principles logic to battery technology at Tesla. Industry experts long assumed batteries would always be expensive, citing a historical cost around $600 per kilowatt-hour for lithium-ion packs​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=Somebody%20could%20say%2C%20%E2%80%9CBattery%20packs,%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>. Musk challenged this. He broke down the contents of a battery cell – <em>“cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers, a sealed can”</em> – and calculated that buying those raw materials on the market would cost roughly $80/kWh​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=With%20first%20principles%2C%20you%20say%2C,value%20of%20the%20material%20constituents%3F%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>. This meant vast room for improvement. By designing battery packs from the cell level up and investing in economies of scale, Tesla could greatly narrow that gap. Musk’s first-principles analysis pointed the way to high-leverage activities for Tesla’s success: invest heavily in battery R&amp;D and manufacturing capability. Tesla’s creation of the Gigafactory (a massive battery production facility) stemmed from this realization that scaling production and improving cell chemistry would massively drive down costs – the key to making electric cars affordable and widespread​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.opstart.ca/the-power-of-high-leverage-activities/#:~:text=Take%20the%20example%20of%20Elon,can%20lead%20to%20monumental%20achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">opstart.ca</span></a></div></span></span>. In effect, Musk identified the battery as the <em>lever</em> to move the entire EV market. Today, Tesla’s battery costs have dropped precipitously and are among the lowest in the industry, enabling longer-range and lower-priced EVs than competitors thought possible.</p><p><strong>Imagining the Ideal and Working Backwards.</strong> Beyond pure physics, Musk uses a mental model of envisioning the <em>platonic ideal</em> of a solution, then figuring out how to get there. He often asks his teams to imagine the perfect outcome unconstrained by current limits (cost, technology, regulations) – essentially <strong>“design the product in your mind with <em>zero</em> limitations, then work backwards to the present to find what’s needed to approach that ideal.”</strong> This approach inspires innovative thinking. For instance, Musk’s vision for SpaceX has always been a fully reusable rocket that works like air travel (fly, land, refuel, fly again). By holding that ideal in mind, SpaceX systematically worked towards it (first reusing small components, then Falcon 9 first stages, now attempting full reuse with Starship). The <em>ideal</em> acts as a north star, keeping efforts focused on the highest-impact goal (total reusability yields an <strong>order-of-magnitude</strong> improvement in cost). Similarly, at Tesla, Musk’s platonic ideal for an EV was one that’s <em>better in every way</em> than a gasoline car – fast, safe, high-tech, and with self-driving capability. That pushed Tesla to prioritize high-leverage features like over-the-air software updates (improving the car continuously at almost no cost), extremely fast acceleration (to showcase EV performance potential), and Autopilot development. By thinking from the “end state” backwards, Musk ensures his companies aren’t doing incremental tweaks when a transformative leap is possible.</p><p><strong>Thinking in First Principles vs. Analogy.</strong> Biographers and colleagues say Musk’s habit of questioning assumptions is <em>second nature</em>. Author Peter Diamandis, who has known Musk for years, notes that Musk <em>“relentlessly pursues the foundations of any problem from fundamental truths”</em>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=First%20Principles%20Thinking" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>. Where others follow industry norms or make decisions by analogy to past examples, Musk instead asks, <em>“What do we know is absolutely true and what is actually just an assumption or habit?”</em> This mindset often lets him identify hidden bottlenecks or opportunities – essentially seeing where to apply leverage. For example, where auto executives assumed car dealerships were a must, Musk questioned that and sold Tesla cars online direct-to-consumer, a high-leverage change eliminating middlemen and markup. When engineers assumed rockets needed dozens of expensive touch-and-go valves, Musk asked if a simpler architecture could work (SpaceX’s Merlin engine ended up with far fewer parts, increasing reliability and easing manufacturing). This contrarian streak – guided by physics and logic – underpins Musk’s decision-making across domains. As he famously said, <em>“The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics; everything else is a recommendation.”</em>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Re%3A%20rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span> In practice, this means if something (a design, process, business model) isn’t forbidden by physics, Musk feels it’s up for re-examination. That gives him and his teams license to attempt seemingly crazy things that might yield exponential gains.</p><h2>Learning from Setbacks and “Immersion” in Problems</h2><p>Another aspect of Musk’s development was his willingness to get hands-on and <em>immersed</em> in the toughest problems. High-leverage opportunities are often spotted by those in the thick of the details. Musk, despite being a CEO, famously dives into engineering and design work. He taught himself rocket science by reading textbooks and hiring experts to quiz (early SpaceX engineers recount Musk absorbing knowledge “like a sponge”). At Tesla, he spends time on the factory floor and in design reviews, scrutinizing parts and processes directly. This technical immersion allows him to personally identify inefficiencies or breakthroughs. As an example, during the Tesla Model 3 “production hell” in 2017–2018, Musk was sleeping at the Fremont factory and troubleshooting robots. He discovered that an automated conveyor for fluffing carpeting into car batteries – the so-called <em>“flufferbot”</em> – was slowing production with no benefit. Musk ordered that robot and the entire fluff process removed, which immediately improved throughput​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.startuparchive.org/p/elon-musk-explains-his-5-step-algorithm-for-running-companies#:~:text=Elon%20shares%20a%20costly%20example,didn%E2%80%99t%20even%20need%20to%20exist" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">startuparchive.org</span></a></div></span></span>. It turned out the “requirement” for a bit of insulation fluff was unnecessary – a perfect case of eliminating something that wasn’t high-leverage. Musk later used this as a lesson that automating or optimizing a step that <em>shouldn’t exist</em> is a common engineering mistake​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.startuparchive.org/p/elon-musk-explains-his-5-step-algorithm-for-running-companies#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20possibly%20the%20most%20common,%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">startuparchive.org</span></a></div></span></span>. By personally digging into the nuts and bolts, he was able to spot that a <em>simpler</em> approach (no fluff at all) was better – a small change with big impact on production speed.</p><p>Musk’s career is peppered with such examples of relentless troubleshooting in pursuit of the critical 20% that drives 80% of the result. In late 2008, with both SpaceX and Tesla on the brink of bankruptcy, Musk famously juggled crises – essentially triaging which problems were most lethal and attacking those. SpaceX had failed three launches in a row; a fourth failure would mean the end. Musk directed all focus to getting Falcon 1 Flight 4 right. That launch succeeded in Sept 2008, <em>just</em> before money ran out, securing NASA contracts that kept SpaceX alive​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=This%20passion%20allowed%20him%20to,times%20and%20take%20big%20risks" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>. Simultaneously, he scraped together a last-minute round of funding for Tesla to survive the financial crisis. These experiences reinforced Musk’s belief in <em>“refusing to give up”</em> and concentrating every resource on the highest-priority problems. Employees who were there in 2008 describe it as a time when Musk’s intensity was at its peak – working 20-hour days, pushing engineers relentlessly, and making tough calls to cut anything non-essential​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=This%20passion%20allowed%20him%20to,times%20and%20take%20big%20risks" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>.

Musk’s teams often consist of such ultra-high-performers, empowered (or compelled) to focus on ambitious targets.</p><p><strong>Leveraging Time and Expertise.</strong> Musk also maximizes his impact by shrewdly leveraging time and talent – both his own and his teams’. He is known to <strong>divide his schedule</strong> between his ventures, often splitting days of the week or even hours of a day shuttling between SpaceX, Tesla, and now X. Rather than try to do everything, he concentrates on the areas where <em>his</em> input yields the most value: engineering design decisions, solving critical technical bottlenecks, and setting product direction. Less critical tasks (day-to-day operations, most marketing, routine finance, etc.) are delegated to others. This is essentially an application of the <strong>Pareto principle</strong> (80/20 rule) to CEO work – Musk puts his energy where his unique combination of technical know-how and authority can make a decisive difference. It’s not uncommon for him to be found reviewing circuit board designs, tweaking spacecraft specifications, or coding a bit of Python for a tool, even as a multi-company CEO. As Musk insists, <em>“all technical managers must have hands-on experience”</em> and leaders shouldn’t ask others to do what they wouldn’t do themselves​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Re%3A%20managers" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Re%3A%20leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. This ethos creates a culture where the leadership is deeply in tune with the product and challenges, enabling faster, more informed decision-making.</p><p>Additionally, Musk has a knack for <strong>drawing in top talent</strong> and using expertise as a force multiplier. Early on, he recruited rocket engineer Tom Mueller to develop SpaceX’s engines and convinced renowned battery scientist JB Straubel to help found Tesla. He often seeks out experts, absorbs their knowledge, and then pushes them (and sometimes overruling them) to go further. By personally understanding the work at a granular level and having strong lieutenants, Musk ensures that the company’s efforts stay oriented toward the most impactful engineering solutions, not just managerial metrics. This approach can ruffle feathers – he will question engineers intensely and has been known to fire people on the spot if he feels they’re a roadblock – but it’s driven by an obsession with <em>results</em>. He famously said, <em>“It’s OK to be wrong, just don’t be <strong>confident</strong> and wrong.”</em>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Re%3A%20failure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span> In other words, bring data or logical reasoning (and be willing to rethink things), which is how he keeps teams focused on finding <em>truth</em> over ego. This culture of intense accountability and open questioning (even of the boss) is another way Musk surfaces the best ideas and squashes wasteful practices – a breeding ground for high-leverage innovation.</p><h2>High-Leverage Focus in Action: Tesla, SpaceX, and Beyond</h2><p>How does Musk’s philosophy translate into concrete actions within his companies? Let’s look at how he identifies and executes high-leverage moves in Tesla, SpaceX, and X (Twitter), along with brief notes on other ventures.</p><h3>Tesla: Revolutionizing Transportation through Key Leverage Points</h3><p>When Musk invested in Tesla (becoming chairman in 2004 and CEO by 2008), electric cars were a niche product – slow, short-range, and extremely expensive. Musk saw that the <em>key lever</em> to change that was <strong>battery technology and volume production</strong>. Tesla’s strategy under Musk zeroed in on improving battery cost and performance, because better batteries would simultaneously increase range, reduce cost per vehicle, and make EVs more practical – unlocking mass adoption. He poured resources into R&amp;D and manufacturing scale. Tesla worked with Panasonic to build the <strong>Gigafactory</strong> in Nevada, one of the world’s largest battery plants, explicitly to drive down unit costs through economies of scale​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.opstart.ca/the-power-of-high-leverage-activities/#:~:text=Take%20the%20example%20of%20Elon,can%20lead%20to%20monumental%20achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">opstart.ca</span></a></div></span></span>. This was a high-leverage bet: spend billions upfront, but in return, remove the biggest barrier to making affordable long-range EVs. It paid off as battery prices fell and Tesla introduced the Model 3, the first <em>mass-market</em> long-range EV.</p><p>Musk also identified <em>design and manufacturing simplification</em> as leverage points. One mantra at Tesla is <em>“the best part is no part”</em> – meaning the most efficient way to improve a car is to remove unnecessary components. This led to bold engineering choices like the <strong>gigacasting</strong> process, where large sections of a car’s body are cast as a single piece (replacing dozens of welded parts). By eliminating complexity, Tesla reduced weight, cost, and assembly time – a ripple effect of benefits from one design change. Musk’s constant questioning of requirements (why <em>do</em> we need 300 parts for the rear underbody?) spurred such innovations. Tesla’s Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, Lars Moravy, noted that using two giant castings (front and rear) plus a structural battery pack in Model Y not only simplified production but also improved vehicle rigidity and range – a win-win​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=2,the%20process%20you%20can" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20it%20is%20all,than%20you%20feel%20comfortable%20with" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. It’s a textbook high-leverage move: one decision (big casting machines) yields multifaceted improvements.</p><p>Another leverage point Musk pursued was <strong>software and autonomy</strong>. Traditional automakers mostly saw value in hardware, but Musk treated Tesla vehicles as computers on wheels. By building a strong software team, Tesla delivered features like over-the-air (OTA) updates that <em>continuously</em> improve cars without physical recalls. This delights customers at little marginal cost – high impact for low effort once the system was in place. Likewise, Tesla’s push into self-driving (Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software) is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. Musk believes a fully self-driving Tesla could dramatically increase the utility of each car (e.g., enabling robotaxi usage). While not yet realized, if achieved, it could be an enormous force multiplier for Tesla’s value. Critics argue he’s over-promised on autonomy timelines, but the strategic intent is clearly to unlock a transformative capability rather than settle for incremental improvements. In Musk’s mind, solving self-driving is a <em>lever</em> that could change transportation at a systems level (reducing accidents, reclaiming commuters’ time, etc.), so it’s worth significant investment.</p><p>Lastly, Musk applied high-leverage thinking to how Tesla sells and services cars. The company avoided the traditional dealership model, selling directly online and building its own network of fast <strong>Supercharger</strong> stations. By investing in the charging network early, Tesla addressed EV range anxiety – a major roadblock to adoption – making Tesla ownership more convenient and thus more attractive. This in-house approach was a heavy lift (financially and logistically), but it created a virtuous cycle: more chargers enabled more Tesla sales, which justified more chargers, and so on. Now Tesla’s charging network is so robust that other carmakers are partnering to use it, effectively turning a former “cost” into an asset. Musk’s willingness to tackle such ancillary but critical factors shows his holistic view of leverage: sometimes the highest-leverage action is to solve a <strong>surrounding problem</strong> (like charging or distribution) that unlocks your product’s main value.</p><h3>SpaceX: Pushing Frontiers with Reuse and Rapid Iteration</h3><p>At SpaceX, Musk’s high-leverage focus has been even more visibly revolutionary. His ultimate goal – making life multi-planetary via Mars – provided a clear guiding question: <em>“What key obstacle, if removed, would radically lower the cost of space travel?”</em> The answer was <strong>rocket reusability</strong>. Decades of launch tradition treated rockets as single-use, which was akin to scrapping a jetliner after one flight – a primary reason space access was so expensive. Musk made reusable rockets SpaceX’s holy grail from early on, even when most aerospace experts said it wasn’t feasible. By focusing on recovering and reusing the Falcon 9 first stage (the largest and costliest part of the rocket), SpaceX achieved a breakthrough: they vertically land boosters and fly them again and again. This innovation has <em>propelled</em> SpaceX to dominate the global launch market. By 2016, Musk could announce that Falcon 9’s first stage had been successfully reused, slashing marginal launch costs. Today, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 routinely reflights boosters a dozen times, and the company has the <strong>lowest cost per kilogram to orbit</strong> in the industry​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.opstart.ca/the-power-of-high-leverage-activities/#:~:text=Take%20the%20example%20of%20Elon,can%20lead%20to%20monumental%20achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">opstart.ca</span></a></div></span></span>. This is a classic example of a high-leverage activity – the engineering effort to make rockets reusable was immense, but once achieved, it yields compounding benefits (cost savings, faster launch cadence, competitor advantage, etc.) for every future mission.</p><p>Another hallmark of SpaceX’s approach is <strong>rapid, iterative development</strong>, which Musk championed as a way to accelerate learning – a leverage of <em>time</em>. Traditional aerospace projects take years per iteration with exhaustive testing on the ground. SpaceX instead embraces an ethos of <em>“build it, break it, learn, and build the next version fast.”</em> They design prototypes quickly and aren’t afraid of failures if they happen during testing. For example, during development of the Starship (SpaceX’s next-generation fully reusable rocket), they conducted a series of high-altitude flight tests in 2020–2021 where multiple Starship prototypes launched and spectacularly exploded on return. Each failure taught the engineers what went wrong, and improvements were made for the next prototype in a matter of weeks. Musk often quotes a maxim: <em>“If you’re not failing, you’re not innovating enough.”</em> By compressing the design-test-fail cycle, SpaceX gains knowledge far faster than a more cautious approach would. This is leveraging <em>feedback loops</em> for maximum effect. It aligns with Musk’s Step 4 in the algorithm (Accelerate cycle time) – faster iteration is itself a high-leverage strategy because it buys more opportunities to improve within a given time. As a result, SpaceX has accomplished feats (like developing a new rocket engine, Raptor, and the Starship vehicle) in a timeframe that legacy players find astonishing.</p><p>SpaceX also benefits from Musk’s knack for <em>simplifying</em> complex systems. Much as Tesla cuts out parts, SpaceX designs rockets with a minimum of moving pieces and tries to integrate functions. Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s president, has mentioned Musk will ask engineers probing questions such as, <em>“Do we really need this avionics box or can the function be done by software? Why is there a combustion stability unit here – can we design the engine to be stable without it?”</em> Challenging every requirement, even in rocketry where safety margins are religion, has paid off. It led SpaceX to innovations like using <strong>pneumatic systems</strong> instead of pyrotechnics to separate rocket stages (making reuse easier), or having the Starship use its main engines for landing (avoiding dedicated landing engines). Each decision to remove or combine parts reduces weight, cost, and potential failure points – clearly high-leverage outcomes for a rocket. As one industry expert noted in <em>Forbes</em>, Musk’s approach to engineering appears <em>“rifle shot rather than scattergun,”</em> aiming to solve core problems directly rather than experimenting with dozens of projects​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/how-elon-musk-solves-problems-4-key-frameworks-17b0e7339af949158d9c0b3a29acd650aa70bcd7#:~:text=How%20Elon%20Musk%20solves%20problems%3A,4%20key%20frameworks%20Getty%20Images" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">news.knowledia.com</span></a></div></span></span>.

Both strategies have merits, but SpaceX’s results speak to how effective Musk’s high-leverage focus has been – in two decades, they went from a scrappy startup to delivering astronauts to the International Space Station and launching the world’s most powerful rocket.</p><h3>Twitter (X): Reimagining a Social Platform at Scale</h3><p>In 2022, Musk turned his attention to social media by acquiring Twitter – a very different arena from cars and rockets, yet he approached it with familiar principles. Musk has long hinted at his interest in creating an “<strong>everything app</strong>” called X, modeled after China’s WeChat, which combines messaging, social networking, payments, and more​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://fortune.com/2022/10/15/elon-musk-twitter-everything-app-x-wechat-america-china/#:~:text=Elon%20Musk%20wants%20to%20offer,X%2C%20the%20everything%20app" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">fortune.com</span></a></div></span></span>. He saw Twitter, with its large user base and real-time communication culture, as a high-leverage starting point to build this broader platform. <em>“Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,”</em> Musk tweeted in October 2022​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://fortune.com/2022/10/15/elon-musk-twitter-everything-app-x-wechat-america-china/#:~:text=,X%2C%20the%20everything%20app" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">fortune.com</span></a></div></span></span>. In other words, he identified Twitter as an underutilized asset that, if transformed with new capabilities, could have far greater impact on how people communicate and transact. This vision itself is an example of spotting potential leverage: the Western world lacks a unified super-app, so there’s an opportunity to be the first mover.</p><p>Upon taking over, Musk moved quickly to strip Twitter down to essentials – reflecting steps 1 and 2 of his algorithm (Question requirements, Delete what you can). He slashed costs by reducing headcount by reportedly 50-70%, eliminated entire layers of management, and challenged longstanding policies (for example, asking “Why can’t we do X?” about features that were stuck in development). This was a shock to the organization, but Musk’s intent was to remove bureaucracy and get back to <em>rapid engineering output</em>. Indeed, within weeks, Twitter (now rebranded <strong>X</strong>) began rolling out new features that had languished: editable tweets for subscribers, long-form posts, subscriber badges, and updates to the algorithm. Whether all these changes were wise remains debated, but the pattern is classic Musk – aggressively experiment, get feedback, and iterate. He told employees that the default should be to <em>“try stuff and do frequent updates,”</em> effectively pushing a startup-like urgency.</p><p>Musk’s identification of high-leverage focuses for X can be seen in a few areas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Subscription and Payments:</strong> He introduced <em>X Premium</em> (formerly Twitter Blue) as a subscription service, aiming to diversify revenue beyond advertising. The leverage here is that even a small percentage of users paying monthly can generate a steady income stream, potentially reducing reliance on volatile ad markets. More strategically, incorporating payments sets the stage for X to handle user-to-user transactions, commerce, or creator monetization – moving towards that everything-app model. Musk has hinted at enabling <em>“the ability to conduct your entire financial world”</em> on X, from payments to banking​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/29/the-x-everything-app-will-launch-this-year-aiming-to-compete-with-apple-pay/#:~:text=The%20X%20Everything%20App%20will," target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">9to5mac.com</span></a></div></span></span>, which signals he’s targeting the very high-leverage goal of turning X into a fintech platform as much as a social network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Free Speech vs. Moderation:</strong> Musk, a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, saw the platform’s content moderation as overly restrictive. By loosening certain rules (and controversially reinstating some banned accounts), he believed Twitter could regain users and influence. This is a social/ideological lever rather than a technical one – essentially betting that a more open forum will increase engagement and make X the “digital town square” he envisions. The jury is still out on the results (some advertisers pulled back due to content concerns), but it shows Musk’s tendency to question existing “requirements” – in this case, norms around content policies – and attempt a bold reset if he thinks it serves the larger goal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Technology Overhaul:</strong> Musk reportedly challenged X’s engineers to rewrite or optimize core parts of the code for efficiency. Anecdotes emerged of him asking why Twitter’s software was so bloated and if it could run faster with less overhead. By cutting thousands of microservices and simplifying code, X did achieve faster performance for some operations. Again, we see the <em>“simplify, then optimize”</em> philosophy at work. Instead of just scaling up servers, Musk looked to simplify architecture first. This mirrors how he approaches hardware: find the simplest effective design, then speed it up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hiring and “Hardcore” Culture:</strong> Musk quickly set a new cultural tone: he asked remaining employees to commit to being “hardcore” – working intense hours and focusing solely on X’s success – or else leave with severance. Many left, but those who stayed were presumably up for the challenge. Musk was effectively trying to distill the workforce down to a highly driven core team, akin to a startup. In theory, a small team of passionate, skilled engineers can outrun a larger, complacent team – a leverage of <em>talent density</em>. This approach is risky (it can burn people out), but Musk has used it at SpaceX and Tesla during crunch times to great effect. When a crisis hits (like Model 3 ramp delays or a rocket test failure), he’ll impose “war time” mode, expecting extraordinary effort from everyone. At X, he instituted that from day one, to jolt the company into faster action.</p></li></ul><p>As X evolves, we see Musk applying his playbook: cut what’s not needed, experiment rapidly, and aim for a long-term grand vision that dwarfs the current business. Whether he can pull off turning Twitter into a Western WeChat is uncertain, but the attempt itself illustrates how he spots leverage points in any domain – even one he’s relatively new to. He looked at Twitter and saw a combination of <em>unrealized product potential</em> and <em>inefficient operations</em>, both of which he believed he could fix by applying first principles and hard-nosed focus. As an investor who has analyzed Musk’s moves put it, <em>“Find your high-leverage activities and eliminate the rest. The Pareto principle in action.”</em>. Musk is doing exactly that with X: identifying the roughly 20% of changes (in personnel, features, and strategy) that might produce 80% of the improvement in the platform’s value.</p><h3>Other Ventures and Consistent Patterns</h3><p>Beyond Tesla, SpaceX, and X, Musk has applied similar thinking in his other ventures:</p><ul><li><p><strong>PayPal (X.com):</strong> Even in the late 1990s, Musk recognized online payments as high-leverage. While his time at PayPal was tumultuous, he strongly pushed for a single, integrated financial service (even proposing a money-market fund for users – a precursor to today’s fintech super apps). His inclination to broaden the scope of a product (to increase its utility) was evident.</p></li><li><p><strong>Neuralink:</strong> Musk co-founded Neuralink to develop brain-machine interfaces. Here the high-leverage idea is that enhancing human cognitive bandwidth could solve many medical problems (paralysis, neurological disorders) and even help humans keep pace with AI. It’s a very high-risk, high-impact play – typical of Musk’s focus on problems that, if solved, would radically change the world. He has driven the Neuralink team with aggressive timelines (sometimes to the dismay of neuroscientists) because he believes the payoff – helping millions of patients and possibly symbiotically merging humans with AI – is worth it.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Boring Company:</strong> This venture addresses traffic by creating tunnels for high-speed transit. Musk identified urban traffic as an “soul-destroying” problem and saw that while many talk about flying cars or public transit, a simpler (first-principles) solution is to go 3D by tunneling. The leverage here is developing tunneling technology that is <em>10X faster and cheaper</em>, which could unlock massive infrastructure projects. Boring Co has built some demo tunnels and is iterating on tunneling machines, though it remains to be seen if it achieves the revolutionary cost reductions Musk envisions.</p></li></ul><p>Across all these, the common thread is Musk homing in on a <em>bottleneck</em> or fundamental issue in a system (payment friction, neural communication limits, traffic congestion) and then assembling a team to tackle it in a novel way. He often states that he prefers to engage in industries that have seen little innovation (space, automotive manufacturing, infrastructure) because that’s where a fresh approach can have <em>outsized impact</em>. In other words, he deliberately hunts for areas where the status quo is stagnant – fertile ground for high-leverage breakthroughs.</p><h2>Musk’s 5-Step Problem-Solving “Algorithm”</h2><p>Many of Musk’s methods have been distilled into what he calls <strong>“The Algorithm,”</strong> a five-step process for solving engineering and design problems. This algorithm, described in Walter Isaacson’s <em>Elon Musk</em> biography and articulated by Musk in interviews, is essentially a playbook for focusing on high-leverage actions while eliminating waste. The steps are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Question Every Requirement.</strong> <em>“First, make your requirements less dumb,”</em> Musk says bluntly​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.startuparchive.org/p/elon-musk-explains-his-5-step-algorithm-for-running-companies#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFirst%2C%20make%20your%20requirements%20less,%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">startuparchive.org</span></a></div></span></span>. He insists that every requirement for a product or process must be understood and justified by a <em>named person</em>. Never accept “because that’s the rule” or “department X says so.” By attaching each requirement to an owner, it forces accountability and invites scrutiny. Musk cautions that <em>requirements from smart or powerful people are the most dangerous</em> because others might not question them​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Musk%3A%20,person%20who%20made%20that%20requirement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. No matter who (even Musk himself) originated a specification, the team must ask: <em>“Is this requirement actually valid, or is it a false assumption?”</em> In practice, this step flushes out a lot of legacy rules or “we’ve always done it this way” habits that may no longer be needed. It ensures you’re solving the right problem before expending effort – the epitome of working smarter, not just harder.</p></li><li><p><strong>Delete Any Part or Process You Can.</strong> Musk literally encourages <strong>subtraction</strong> as an art. <em>“If you’re not adding back at least 10% of the things you remove, you’re not removing enough,”</em> he quips​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20it%20is%20all,than%20you%20feel%20comfortable%20with" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. This means engineers should aggressively simplify by removing components, steps, or features and see if the system still works. It’s better to <em>start with a clean slate and add back necessary elements</em> than to fight uphill against complexity. By cutting out anything non-essential, you often reveal simpler ways to achieve the goal. This step is high-leverage because every part or process you remove is one less thing to design, maintain, carry cost, and potentially fail. Musk has applied this at Tesla (eliminating parts in the design, as with the flufferbot removal or combining functions into one controller) and at SpaceX (deleting whole stages or mechanisms in rocket designs that proved unnecessary). It’s an antidote to the natural tendency of organizations to accrete bureaucracy and complexity over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplify and Optimize (Only <strong>After</strong> Steps 1 &amp; 2).</strong> Only <strong>once</strong> the requirements are questioned and the unnecessary elements deleted should you focus on optimizing what remains​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.startuparchive.org/p/elon-musk-explains-his-5-step-algorithm-for-running-companies#:~:text=3,process%20that%20should%20not%20exist" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">startuparchive.org</span></a></div></span></span>. Musk warns that a common error is <em>“simplifying or optimizing a part that should not exist”</em>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.startuparchive.org/p/elon-musk-explains-his-5-step-algorithm-for-running-companies#:~:text=3,process%20that%20should%20not%20exist" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">startuparchive.org</span></a></div></span></span>. If you skip to optimization too early, you risk beautifully streamlining a process that in hindsight was pointless. By waiting until you have a lean, essential system, you ensure that any efficiency improvements or refinements are being applied to something that truly needs to be there. In Musk’s words, <em>“a common mistake among smart engineers is to work on optimizing the thing that should simply not exist”</em>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.startuparchive.org/p/elon-musk-explains-his-5-step-algorithm-for-running-companies#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20possibly%20the%20most%20common,%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">startuparchive.org</span></a></div></span></span>. This step in the algorithm encourages focusing your creative energies where they will have real impact. Once you’ve trimmed the fat, you can simplify designs (make parts more modular, designs more elegant) and optimize performance (faster, lighter, stronger) without fear that you’re polishing a dud. In Musk’s companies, after the brutal culling in steps 1 and 2, engineers indeed spend a lot of time innovating on what’s left – whether it’s improving battery chemistry, squeezing more thrust from an engine, or streamlining the UI of an app.</p></li><li><p><strong>Accelerate Cycle Time.</strong> Now turn your attention to speed. <em>“Every process can be sped up,”</em> Musk notes​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=The%20fourth%20step%20of%20Musk%27s,speed%20up%20your%20bureaucratic%20processes" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. The faster you can iterate, the more shots you have at solving the problem and the sooner you get feedback. However, Musk attaches a big caveat: do this <strong>after</strong> the first three steps​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=,realized%20should%20have%20been%20deleted" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. There’s no point in accelerating a process you haven’t vetted or that includes fluff. But if you have a simplified system, then figure out how to execute each cycle faster. This might mean parallelizing tasks, reducing wait times, or automating some steps (though Musk actually treats automation as a separate last step). The idea is to <em>compress the development or production schedule</em> as much as possible. Musk gives the example that at Tesla he once spent a lot of effort speeding up a production line process, only to later realize that process could be deleted entirely​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=,realized%20should%20have%20been%20deleted" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span> – hence the order of operations. When done right, faster cycle time is hugely leveraging: it lets you try more things in the same time frame and learn quickly. SpaceX exemplifies this with rapid prototyping of Starship; Tesla did similar with its software updates and quick feature rollout. It’s essentially <strong>agile development</strong> writ large – smaller, faster iterations trump massive, slow rollouts because they adapt to reality sooner.</p></li><li><p><strong>Automate Last.</strong> The final step is <em>automation</em>, and Musk deliberately puts this last​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. He cautions against the instinct to automate everything from the start (a lesson he learned the hard way with the over-automation of the Model 3 factory)​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Musk%3A%20,the%20bugs%20were%20shaken%20out" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. <em>“Automation is great for efficiency, but if you automate a flawed process, you just mess things up faster,”</em> he has noted in interviews. So, once you’ve done steps 1-4 – clarified what’s needed, removed waste, simplified, and sped things up – then you identify which remaining steps are ripe for automation or mechanization. At that point, you have high confidence that each step is necessary and as simple as it can be; automating it will yield true efficiency gains. In essence, automation multiplies the output of a process, so you want to be certain you’re multiplying the right thing. Musk’s mantra became <em>“Automation should come after you’ve ironed out the bugs manually”</em>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Musk%3A%20,the%20bugs%20were%20shaken%20out" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. In Tesla’s case, after reworking the Model 3 assembly with fewer steps and better flow, they then reintroduced certain robots and automated conveyors to scale up volume. Likewise, SpaceX automates much of its rocket fueling, launch prep, and even docking procedures – but only after perfecting them with humans in the loop first.</p></li></ol><p>This five-step algorithm is a powerful framework for <strong>anyone</strong> looking to improve a system or product. It’s essentially Musk’s guiding process to ensure his teams work on high-leverage tasks at every stage:</p><ul><li>Steps 1 and 2 (question and delete) make sure you’re focused on the <em>right</em> problems and not wasting effort – this maximizes leverage by concentrating energy only on what truly matters.</li><li>Step 3 (simplify/optimize) ensures the solution is as effective and elegant as possible – increasing the impact of the design.</li><li>Step 4 (accelerate) makes the development process itself high-leverage by gaining time and knowledge faster than others.</li><li>Step 5 (automate) then scales up the high-leverage solution for maximum output.</li></ul><p>Musk has ingrained this into the culture at Tesla and SpaceX.

It effectively institutionalizes a high-leverage mindset – continuously questioning, refining, and doubling down on what works.</p><h2>Perspectives from Biographers and Colleagues</h2><p>Musk’s approach to identifying and executing on high-leverage activities has been both lauded and critiqued by those who have studied him or worked with him. Here are a few perspectives:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ashlee Vance (biographer of <em>Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</em>):</strong> Vance portrays Musk as exceptionally <em>visionary and driven</em>, but also notes the toll his demanding style can take.

Vance’s account makes clear that Musk’s ability to get people to pour themselves into high-leverage work – to <em>“go through a wall”</em> if needed – is a major factor in his companies’ achievements, but it comes at the cost of a bruising work culture. Musk’s response is that accomplishing revolutionary things simply isn’t possible with a normal 9-to-5 approach.</p></li><li><p><strong>Walter Isaacson (biographer of <em>Elon Musk</em>, 2023):</strong> Isaacson had up-close access to Musk in recent years and describes his dual nature – inspirational one moment and mercurial the next. Isaacson observed Musk in what employees call “demon mode,” where he becomes intensely focused and can be <em>“coldly brutal to people”</em> in the pursuit of a solution​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.benzinga.com/topic/elon-musk#:~:text=,Jan%2030%2C%202025%2C%205" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">benzinga.com</span></a></div></span></span>. During these phases, Musk’s empathy drops out and he’ll scorch through interpersonal niceties if he believes someone or something is impeding progress. This can result in firings or tongue-lashings that create fear, but it also often <em>unblocks</em> issues. Isaacson’s book recounts meetings where Musk would drill into an engineer’s reasoning until either the logic proved sound or the requirement was exposed as flawed – reflecting Step 1 of his algorithm in real time. Isaacson does highlight Musk’s almost uncanny ability to zoom into the technical weeds, identify the critical path, and motivate the team to rally around it. In one episode, Tesla engineers were struggling with the design of the Cybertruck’s unique steel exoskeleton. Musk entered “demon mode” to insist on simplifications and material changes that seemed radical, but ultimately made the design viable. As Isaacson notes, Musk’s intensity <em>“bends people to his vision,”</em> and while many fall by the wayside, those who adapt can accomplish career-defining work under his leadership.</p></li><li><p><strong>Employees and Associates:</strong> Many former and current employees have spoken (sometimes anonymously) about Musk’s leadership.

It’s a kind of trial by fire that forges innovation. <strong>Gwynne Shotwell</strong>, President of SpaceX, has praised Musk’s vision and intelligence, but also has the task of “translating” his grand goals into practical plans. She once said that part of her job is to be more realistic about timelines with customers even as Musk pushes internally at breakneck speed. <strong>Jim Cantrell</strong>, an early SpaceX engineer, recounted how Musk was not afraid to challenge experts: when Russian rocket vendors offered outrageously priced vehicles, Musk walked away and decided to build it himself​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">achieve-personaltraining.com</span></a></div></span></span>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">achieve-personaltraining.com</span></a></div></span></span>.

He notes that Musk’s deep passion for his missions gives him the fortitude to take risks and ignore naysayers – which is crucial when pursuing high-leverage but unconventional ideas. Tech analyst <strong>Jodie Cook</strong>, writing in <em>Forbes</em>, contrasted Musk’s “rifle shot” strategy to Jeff Bezos’s more scattershot experimentation​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/how-elon-musk-solves-problems-4-key-frameworks-17b0e7339af949158d9c0b3a29acd650aa70bcd7#:~:text=Contrasting%20Musk%20to%20Jeff%20Bezos%2C,fail%20in%20a%20big%20way" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">news.knowledia.com</span></a></div></span></span>. Both have merit, but Musk’s focused approach means each venture he starts aims to rewrite the rules of an industry (electric cars, rockets, etc.) rather than dabble in many. This focus on only a few big bets at a time is itself an application of leverage: Musk doesn’t start a project unless he believes it can be <em>“the best in the world”</em> or solve a significant problem. It’s an all-in style that can seem reckless, but as Cook notes, it has resulted in an unprecedented streak of successes​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/how-elon-musk-solves-problems-4-key-frameworks-17b0e7339af949158d9c0b3a29acd650aa70bcd7#:~:text=Whatever%20you%20think%20of%20him%2C,success%20rate%20is%20incredibly%20high" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">news.knowledia.com</span></a></div></span></span>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/how-elon-musk-solves-problems-4-key-frameworks-17b0e7339af949158d9c0b3a29acd650aa70bcd7#:~:text=,fail%20in%20a%20big%20way" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">news.knowledia.com</span></a></div></span></span>.

He’s willing to do things most CEOs wouldn’t – sleeping on factory floors, personally interviewing engineers, publicly testing prototypes, and scrapping entire departments – all in service of advancing the critical path. This relentless prioritization of high-impact objectives is what sets him apart. It’s not just raw IQ or technical knowledge (though he has plenty); it’s his mental models and sheer will to act on them that create results.

However, there are many practical lessons and techniques we can draw from his playbook to improve our own ability to identify and execute on high-leverage activities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ask the Big Questions First.</strong> Musk’s journey started by asking, <em>“What will most affect the future?”</em> In our context, this means clearly define the big goal or problem you want to solve. Don’t get lost in trivial tasks without understanding how (or if) they contribute to your overarching mission. Regularly zoom out and ensure you’re working on something that truly matters in the long run. As Musk’s favorite book taught him, <em>“framing the right question”</em> is paramount​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.foundingfuel.com/article/ff-insights-645-elon-musk-and-the-art-of-asking-the-right-questions/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Hitchhiker%E2%80%99s%20Guide%20to%20the,%E2%80%99" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">foundingfuel.com</span></a></div></span></span>. Try to articulate the primary question for your project or career (e.g. “What do our customers <em>really</em> need that no one is providing?”). That will guide you toward high-impact efforts and away from busywork.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use First-Principles Thinking.</strong> Whenever you face a problem, channel your inner physicist. Break the issue down to basics: what do you know for sure, and what is just assumption or convention? Challenge the givens. If something is expensive, ask “why” repeatedly – you might uncover that a cheaper approach exists (like Musk did with rockets and batteries by calculating raw material costs​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">achieve-personaltraining.com</span></a></div></span></span>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=With%20first%20principles%2C%20you%20say%2C,value%20of%20the%20material%20constituents%3F%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>). In your own work, this could mean questioning a longstanding business process (“Do we really need this approval chain, or could one person handle it?”) or a cost (“What if we built this component in-house – what are the actual material and labor costs vs. the price we pay suppliers?”). By reasoning from the ground up, you might spot non-obvious solutions that save time or money. <strong>Action item:</strong> For a challenge you’re facing, list the fundamental facts and then brainstorm alternatives from scratch, ignoring how it’s been done before.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identify the 20% Tasks that Yield 80% of Results.</strong> The Pareto principle is a practical way to start thinking in terms of leverage. Make a list of your activities or your team’s projects. Force yourself to pick which few have the highest impact on your goals; which are “moving the needle” and which are just maintenance or minor improvements. Musk excels at this – he allocates his time and resources heavily to the big wins (e.g., battery tech, rocket reusability) and cuts back on distractions. Once you identify these high-leverage tasks, <strong>prioritize</strong> them relentlessly. Schedule them for when you have the most energy, give them more resources, and communicate to your team that these are the must-wins. Equally, <strong>eliminate or delegate</strong> the low-leverage work. Musk delegates extensively on things like routine operations, PR, legal, etc., so he can focus on engineering and design. You might not have a staff to delegate to, but you can drop unnecessary meetings, automate reports, or outsource tasks that aren’t the best use of your time. As one productivity expert summarizing Musk’s style put it: <em>“Find your high-leverage activities and eliminate the rest.”</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Question Requirements &amp; Conventional Wisdom.</strong> Adopt Musk’s Step 1: don’t do things just because “that’s how it’s done.” Cultivate a healthy skepticism toward every requirement or tradition in your organization. If a rule or process doesn’t make sense to you, politely ask for the reasoning behind it. Sometimes you’ll find there was a good reason; but many times even the authorities might admit, “We inherited this practice and never changed it.” By questioning requirements, you may discover opportunities to simplify (Step 2 of Musk’s algorithm). For instance, maybe you realize a report that takes hours to produce each week isn’t actually used by anyone – time to stop doing it. Or a product feature that’s adding complexity could be removed with negligible customer impact. <strong>Practical tip:</strong> When starting a new project, list all assumed requirements and next to each write <em>who</em> requested it and <em>why</em>. If you can’t find a compelling why, flag it for re-evaluation​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=That%20clarity%20can%20be%20made,person%20who%20made%20that%20requirement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=sense,how%20%27powerful%27%20that%20person%20is" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simplify, Then Simplify Some More.</strong> Take Musk’s advice: <em>delete before you optimize</em>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.startuparchive.org/p/elon-musk-explains-his-5-step-algorithm-for-running-companies#:~:text=3,process%20that%20should%20not%20exist" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">startuparchive.org</span></a></div></span></span>. Look at a process you’re involved in – it could be as simple as your morning routine or as complex as a product launch pipeline. Ask, “What would happen if we removed this step or element?” You might trial removing or bypassing steps to see if the outcome is still acceptable. This is essentially A/B testing your process with a “light” version. Don’t be afraid to trim things down to the bare essentials; you can always add back if needed (Musk suggests if you never have to add back ~10%, you weren’t bold enough in cutting​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20it%20is%20all,than%20you%20feel%20comfortable%20with" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>). Once you have a lean process, <em>then</em> put effort into optimizing it – whether through better tools, better training, or minor tweaks. The result will be a far more efficient workflow than optimizing a bloated process. Remember, every part or step you remove is one less thing to manage or worry about, which frees up time and mental space for more important matters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Embrace Rapid Iteration and Feedback.</strong> Musk’s style shows that taking action and learning quickly beats months of theorizing. Whenever possible, break big projects into smaller experiments or prototypes that you can test. If you have a product idea, create a rough version or even a mock-up and get it in front of users for feedback. If you’re trying to improve a skill, don’t over-plan your study – start practicing and refine your approach as you see what works. The key is to shorten the loop: idea → implement → feedback → improve. Musk does this with rockets blowing up and software updates coming bi-weekly. You can do it with pilot programs, drafts, and frequent check-ins. <strong>Tip:</strong> Set artificial deadlines to force a version out, even if it’s not perfect. The feedback or results will guide you better than endless internal debates. In Musk’s words, <em>“The longer you wait to fire the arrow, the less time you have to find where it landed and adjust your aim.”</em> Accelerating your “cycle time” on work or learning means you gain experience faster than peers, which is a compounding advantage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cultivate Multi-Disciplinary Knowledge.</strong> One reason Musk can identify leverage points in disparate industries is that he has deliberately learned the fundamentals of many fields – physics, software, electrical engineering, mechanical design, finance, and more. This broad base allows him to cross-pollinate ideas (for instance, applying software versioning concepts to manufacturing, or physics models to business problems). You can emulate this by developing your own “T-shaped” skill set: deep in one area, but broad across many. Read widely, take online courses, or just be curious beyond your job description. If you’re in engineering, learn a bit about finance; if you’re in marketing, learn some data analytics or coding. Musk famously said, <em>“It is useful to view knowledge as a sort of semantic tree – make sure you understand the fundamental principles (the trunk and big branches) before you get into the leaves/details.”</em> By having strong trunks in multiple disciplines, you’ll spot connections others miss and identify innovative solutions that draw from different domains. It also helps in communicating with experts – Musk can challenge his engineers because he speaks their language to an extent. Being a generalist with some specialties is a force multiplier in problem-solving.</p></li><li><p><strong>Build a Fearless Attitude Toward Failure (and Long Hours).</strong> There’s no denying that Musk’s methods involve taking risks and a lot of hard work. To apply even a fraction of his mindset, one must become more comfortable with failure as a learning tool. If you only attempt things you’re 100% sure will succeed, you’re likely not choosing high-leverage, ambitious goals. Musk’s teams attempt things with maybe 50-70% chance of success and treat failure as <em>data</em>. Adopting a similar view can free you to pursue more impactful projects without being paralyzed by the possibility of failing. Of course, not everyone wants to work 16-hour days or should – balance is important – but the core idea is to put serious effort behind your high-leverage goals. It might mean learning new skills after work, or investing weekends to kickstart a personal project. Musk often says, <em>“When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.”</em> That drive is what saw him through the 2008 crisis​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/deconstructing-elon-musk#:~:text=This%20passion%20allowed%20him%20to,times%20and%20take%20big%20risks" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">diamandis.com</span></a></div></span></span>.

Musk leverages vision as a tool: his employees aren’t just building cars, they are <em>“accelerating the transition to sustainable energy”</em>; they’re not just coding a payment app, they’re <em>“transforming global finance”</em>. A compelling vision is a motivational lever – it yields effort and creativity from people beyond what a paycheck might. Communicate the “why” of what you’re doing. Then, empower yourself or your team to figure out the “how” with minimal constraints. Musk’s companies, despite his heavy involvement, give engineers a lot of agency to solve problems. He sets insanely high targets, but often leaves it to the experts to figure out the details (he intervenes mainly when he feels they’re off-track or not ambitious enough). Similarly, in your project, once the goal and parameters are clear, trust the people doing the work – including yourself – to try novel approaches. This autonomy can surface new high-leverage ideas from anyone, not just top leaders. As Musk implemented with his <strong>skip-level meetings</strong> (going directly to junior engineers for the real story​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Re%3A%20problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>), sometimes the best insights come from those closest to the work.</p></li></ul><p>By applying these principles – asking the right questions, focusing on fundamentals, pruning the inessential, iterating quickly, and staying bold and curious – you can start to develop a Musk-like eye for leverage. It’s about maximizing the return on your intelligence, time, and effort. Not everyone will be an Elon Musk (and frankly, not everyone wants to endure his stress levels), but everyone can learn to work a bit more like him: more <em>strategically</em>, more <em>fearlessly</em>, and more <em>purposefully</em>.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Elon Musk’s ability to identify high-leverage activities across wildly different domains is not magic; it’s the result of clear thinking, deep knowledge, and a courageous willingness to break the mold. From his early love of science fiction and physics, he learned to question the ordinary and think big. Through formative ventures and failures, he honed a keen sense of priority – figuring out which problems, if solved, would unlock the most value. In practice, Musk applies mental models like first-principles reasoning, “thinking in the limit,” and his 5-step algorithm to cut through complexity and find those crucial levers that move his companies forward. Whether it’s a technical breakthrough (reusable rockets, giant casting machines) or a strategic shift (betting on an everything-app, open-sourcing patents), he gravitates to the moves that offer <strong>10x</strong> improvements rather than 10%. Crucially, he couples this with intense execution – pushing himself and his teams to turn these insights into reality, even if it means sprinting through “impossible” deadlines and staring down failure.</p><p>For observers and aspiring innovators, Musk’s story offers both inspiration and a toolkit. The inspiration is to <strong>choose worthy problems</strong> and attack them with zeal, believing as Musk does that <em>“only the laws of physics are limits”</em>​<span><span class="" data-state="closed"><div class="relative inline-flex items-center"><a href="https://www.corporate-rebels.com/blog/musks-algorithm-to-cut-bureaucracy#:~:text=Re%3A%20rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="ml-1 inline-flex h-[22px] items-center rounded-xl bg-[#f4f4f4] px-2 text-[0.5em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary dark:bg-token-main-surface-secondary relative top-[-0.094rem] !text-token-text-secondary uppercase hover:bg-token-text-primary hover:!text-token-main-surface-secondary dark:hover:bg-token-text-primary group"><span class="truncate">corporate-rebels.com</span></a></div></span></span>. The toolkit is a set of principles and practices – from always asking <em>“why?”</em> to never accepting “this is how it’s done,” from simplifying designs to iterating fast – that can increase the impact of whatever work you do. You don’t need to build rockets to use these ideas; they apply to managing a team, launching a startup, or even organizing your personal goals. By focusing on high-leverage activities, you ensure that your time and energy are directed at the things that truly matter.</p><p>Elon Musk’s approach is not without controversy or cost – not everyone agrees with his methods or wants to work under his “demon mode.” But even his critics acknowledge that he has accomplished feats previously deemed impossible, often ahead of schedule. The lesson is that breakthrough progress often requires a different kind of thinking and operating. Musk himself puts it simply: <em>“Focus on signal over noise. Don’t waste time on stuff that doesn’t actually make things better.”</em> In a world full of noise, Musk’s high-leverage mindset is tuned almost obsessively to the signal – and that is something we can all learn from.</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong></p><ul><li>Diamandis, Peter. “Deconstructing Elon Musk.” <em>Diamandis.com</em>.
